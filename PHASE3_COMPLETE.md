## Integration with Previous Phases
- **Phase 1 Integration**:
  - Configuration system provides instrument addresses and settings
  - Logging system captures all test activities with run correlation
  - Database system stores all test results with structured relationships

- **Phase 2 Integration**:
  - HAL interfaces used consistently across all tests
  - Mock instruments provide hardware-free testing
  - Driver polymorphism enables test portability

## Usage Examples

### Simple Test Execution
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test category
pytest -m unit
pytest -m integration
pytest -m power_management

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/integration/power_management/test_voltage_regulation.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Test Development
```python
@pytest.mark.integration
@pytest.mark.power_management
def test_voltage_accuracy(mock_power_supply, mock_multimeter, test_logger):
    """Test power supply voltage accuracy."""
    # Configure power supply
    mock_power_supply.set_voltage(5.0)
    mock_power_supply.set_output_state(True)

    # Measure voltage
    measured = mock_multimeter.measure_dc_voltage()

    # Log measurement with limits
    test_logger.log_measurement(
        name="output_voltage",
        value=measured,
        unit="V",
        limits={"min": 4.95, "max": 5.05}
    )

    # Verify result
    assert 4.95 <= measured <= 5.05
```

### Parametrized Testing
```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("voltage,tolerance", [
    (3.3, 0.05),
    (5.0, 0.05),
    (12.0, 0.1),
])
def test_voltage_levels(voltage, tolerance, mock_power_supply, test_logger):
    """Test multiple voltage levels with different tolerances."""
    mock_power_supply.set_voltage(voltage)
    # Test implementation...
```

## Advanced Features Demonstrated
- **Fixture Scoping**: Optimal resource management with session vs function scopes
- **Dependency Injection**: Automatic provision of configured test resources
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Custom test execution flow with setup/teardown
- **Marker Automation**: Automatic test categorization based on location
- **Data Persistence**: Automatic storage of all test results and measurements
- **Mock Integration**: Seamless testing without hardware dependencies

The test execution engine provides a production-ready framework for comprehensive hardware testing with enterprise-level features like full traceability, automated reporting, and flexible test organization. All tests can run completely hardware-free using the mock implementations, while the same test code works identically with real hardware.

## Ready for Phase 4
The Test Definition and Execution Engine is now complete and ready for Phase 4, where we'll implement results processing, data analysis with Pandas, and automated reporting with Jinja2 templates.
